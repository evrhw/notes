- found water was 1/9th hydrogen
- 8/9ths oxygen
- didn't matter source all water was the same
- Mass is neither of created or destroyed
- Dalton clamed that pure substome were compoased of the smae number of relative number and type of building blocked
Law of Definite Prportions

Dalton's Atomic Theory
- Atoms are tiny spheres
- Atoms of a given element are identical different eliments are not identical
- atoms cant be created or destroyed
- come together to form compounds
- atoms are rearranged in chemical reactions
Isotopes
- are same element but different number of neutrons
- identified by atomic mass
Average atomic mass
- mass listed on periodic table
- its average of all isotopes and their % of abundunce
- how its calculated
	- find percent of abundance and atomic mass of each naturally occuring isotopes
	- change percents into decimals by deviding my 100
	- multipy each percent by mass
	- sum
