[[The Atom||Neucleaus]]
Radioactive decay
- Unstable nuclei emit radiation to attain more stable atomic configurations
	- Only 17% are stable and do not decay spontaneously
- Atoms lose energy by emitting one of several types of radiation
- the decay is spontaneous and does not require any input of energy
- The strong nuclear force overcomes the electrostatic repulsion between protons
- Alpha Decay
	- Large mass
	- Move slowly
	- positively charged
	- Mass # down by 4
	- atomic # down by 2
	- alpha particle is a helium nucleus
	-
